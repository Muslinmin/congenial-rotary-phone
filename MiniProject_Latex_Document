    \caption{Flowchart of the Pan Angle Routine}
    \label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure}
Explain the application algorithm used in detail, including any flowcharts if necessary. Discuss how parameters are determined for the intended purpose of the algorithms. For example, to compute distance with an ultrasonic sensor, the speed of sound is a parameter used.

The algorithm implemented in this project enables the ultrasonic sensor to perform automated panning movements using a servomotor, allowing the sensor to scan the surrounding environment and detect obstacles within a specified threshold distance.

\subsection{Algorithm Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization:}
    The system starts by initializing essential components, including the ultrasonic sensor, servomotor, and a data plot table for storing sensor readings. An obstacle detection threshold is set at \textbf{60 cm}, meaning any object within this range is considered an obstacle that the system must detect.

    \item \textbf{Continuous Scanning Loop:}
    The system enters an infinite loop (\textbf{While 1}) to continuously scan the environment. The servomotor's angle (\textit{pan\_angle}) is initialized and constrained between \textbf{0° and 180°} for a wide panning range. If the angle is less than or equal to \textbf{180°}, the ultrasonic sensor gathers distance data as the servo pans across the range.

    \item \textbf{Subroutine for Pan Angle:}
    The system invokes the \textbf{PanAngleSubRoutine} at each increment of the pan angle, where the ultrasonic sensor checks for obstacles within the \textbf{60 cm} threshold. If an obstacle is detected, its position is flagged or stored. After each scan, the \textit{pan\_angle} is incremented by \textbf{1°} until it reaches \textbf{180°}. Once the full scan is completed, the algorithm resets the \textit{pan\_angle} and repeats the process to ensure continuous obstacle detection.

    \item \textbf{Subroutine Explanation:}
    The \textbf{PanAngleSubRoutine} processes the ultrasonic sensor's data at each angle step, evaluating and storing the distance to detected objects. If an obstacle is detected within the threshold, this data can be logged or used for immediate system actions, such as alerts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Parameter Determination}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Speed of Sound:} A critical parameter in this algorithm is the \textbf{speed of sound}, used by the ultrasonic sensor to calculate distances. The distance to an object is computed using the formula:
    \[
    d = \frac{\Delta t \times V_s}{2}
    \]
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( d \) is the distance to the obstacle.
        \item \( \Delta t \) is the time taken for the sound waves to travel to the object and back.
        \item \( V_s \) is the speed of sound in air (typically 343 m/s at room temperature).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Obstacle Threshold:} The obstacle detection threshold is predefined at \textbf{60 cm}, flagging any object within this distance for action.

    \item \textbf{Panning Range:} The panning range is set between \textbf{0° and 180°}, ensuring wide coverage by the ultrasonic sensor as it scans the surroundings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Explanation of Key Sections}
Break down and explain important parts of the code, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distance measurement using the ultrasonic sensor:} The ultrasonic sensor works by emitting sound waves and measuring the time it takes for them to bounce back after hitting an obstacle. The formula to calculate the distance is:
    \[
    \text{Distance} = \frac{\Delta t \times V_s}{2}
    \]
    where \(\Delta t\) is the time taken for the signal to return, and \(V_s\) is the speed of sound in air.

    \item \textbf{Actuator control for forward, backward, and turning:} This section of the code handles the control of motors, making the robot move forward, backward, or turn depending on sensor input.

    \item \textbf{Application logic:} The main logic determines how the robot reacts to obstacles. For instance, if an obstacle is detected within a certain distance, the robot could stop, turn, or move in another direction.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Testing and Results}

\section{Overview}
This section aims to characterize the ultrasonic sensor by examining its performance under various conditions, including its deadband in close proximity, maximum measurable distance, and accuracy influenced by environmental temperature and humidity. To ensure measurement accuracy, the actual speed of sound, affected by these environmental factors, is determined and used for calibration. \\\\The test cases are summarized in the follow keypoints:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison between expected distances and measured distance (accuracy)
    \item Testing the minimum detectable distance (close proximity)
    \item Testing the maximum detectable distance (range limit)
\end{itemize}
    
\section{Testing Setup}
Describe the environment used for testing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Location:} Living room, flat surface, 9 metres length and 5 metres wide of space for testing. 

    \item \textbf{Challenges:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Sensor calibration:} Initial distance measurements showed slight discrepancies, primarily due to variations in environmental temperature and humidity. These factors affected the speed of sound, requiring adjustments on the speed of sound in code to achieve accurate readings.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}
Summarize the results of the testing process. Include photos or videos of the robot in action (if available). Discuss how effectively the robot met the project objectives.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Project Summary}

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection in smoke-filled environments. Key accomplishments include obtaining reliable distance measurements across different environmental conditions, with readings consistently within acceptable tolerances. The system also provided real-time visual feedback through an LED indicator when the detection threshold was crossed. Additionally, servomotor integration enabled automated panning movements, expanding the sensor's field of view. These results underscore the potential of ultrasonic sensors in low-visibility conditions and establish a solid foundation for further enhancements and optimizations.




\section{Challenges}

During the project, several challenges were encountered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Speed of Sound Variations}: The speed of sound changes in different environments, affecting the accuracy of distance measurements. 
    
    \textbf{\textit{Solution:}} To maintain measurement accuracy, the sensor required recalibration at each testing location due to environmental factors influencing the speed of sound. This process involved adjusting the system parameters to account for variations in air pressure, temperature, and humidity, ensuring consistent and reliable performance across different test environments.
    
    \item \textbf{Noise Filtering}: Unwanted noise interference was present during testing, which affected the sensor's precision in detecting obstacles. This necessitated the implementation of filtering techniques to improve accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Field of View (FOV) and Accuracy Tradeoff}: Balancing the sensor’s FOV with detection accuracy proved challenging. A wider FOV resulted in inconsistent readings, causing the system to occasionally miss obstacles, as demonstrated by erratic blinking in the detection system.
    
    \textbf{\textit{Solution:}} FOV was narrowed to focus on a more confined detection area, improving precision
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Future Improvements}
Suggest improvements that could be made to the robot in future versions, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Sensor Fusion**: Exploring the integration of multiple sensors, such as infrared or LiDAR, would enhance the system’s versatility, allowing the system to perform better in a wider range of environmental conditions such as dimly lit spaces. It would also allow for detailed 3D mapping in different environments.

    \item **Advanced Filtering Algorithms**: Implementing advanced filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters, would further refine sensor data, reducing noise and improving accuracy, especially in dynamic environments.

    \item **Porting 3D Rotational Capabilities to Rescue Robots**: Leveraging the system's 3D rotational capabilities by integrating it into rescue robots could provide enhanced environmental scanning, allowing robots to effectively detect and navigate obstacles in hazardous and smoke-filled environments.
